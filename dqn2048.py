# MODEL HYPERPARMETERS:

# Set the DQN/Neural Network type and some hyperparameters (further ones can be specified later):

# DQN/Neural Network type:
MODEL_TYPE = 'dnn'  # 3-layer dnn (deep neural network / multi-layer perceptron / feed-forward neural network / dense neural network)
# MODEL_TYPE = 'cnn1' # convolutional neural network (vanilla)
# MODEL_TYPE = 'cnn2' # convolutional neural network (with "orthogonal" strides)

# Input/output layers parameters:
NUM_ACTIONS_OUTPUT_NN = 4  # number of agent's actions (corresponds to the number of neurons for the neural network's output layer)
# WINDOW_LENGTH:
#    - number of historical states (observations) from the environment to provide to the neural network/DQN agent
#    - the process, describing the evolution of the game 2048, is fully observable because each board-matrix fully describes the state
#      of the process at each step, hence there is no need for WINDOW_LENGTH > 1. For the same reason there is no need to use a 
#      recurrent neural network (RNN), in place of a deep neural network or a convolutional neural network, because the state of the RNN
#      would probably memorize useless information.
#    - ATTENTION: the code has not been tested for values of WINDOW_LENGTH different from 1
WINDOW_LENGTH = 1
INPUT_SHAPE = (4, 4)  # game-grid/matrix size (corresponds to the input shape for the neural network)

PREPROC = "onehot2steps"  # One-Hot Encoding; explained in detail in module "processors2048.py"
NUM_ONE_HOT_MAT = 16  # number of matrices to use for encoding each game-grid in the one-hot encoding pre-processing

# Set the training hyperparameters:
# BATCH_SIZE = 256 # neural network's batch size (number of examples in each batch)
NB_STEPS_TRAINING = 100000  # int(5e6) # number of steps used for training the model
NB_STEPS_ANNEALED = int(1e5)  # number of steps used in LinearAnnealedPolicy()

# NEURAL NETWORK MODELS:

# Load Keras model (if already trained/partially trained and saved) otherwise build a new one
# ISSUE TO SOLVE - SAVING MODEL'S OPTIMIZER/TRAINING STATE:
#    - the neural network model is defined using Keras but it is built and trained using Keras-RL library (DQNAgent() and fit() functions)
#      hence we cannot use the Keras function save() (https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) to save the 
#      model's optimizer/training state (e.g., state of the learning rate in the Adam optimization method) in case we want to resume the 
#      training and keep improving the model.
#      We can still save the model architecture using Keras function save() and the trained weights using Keras-RL callback function
#      ModelIntervalCheckpoint() but these, on their own, are useful only for the testing phase.
#    - Attempt to save the model's optimizer state & pickle error:
#      I have tried to serialize the object (built with DQNAgent()) storing the model's architecture and optimizer state using the pickle
#      library but I encountered the error "TypeError: can't pickle _thread.RLock objects" which seems caused by the fact that Python
#      cannot pickle lambda expressions like the ones used in Tensorflow (https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/8343,
#      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44855603/typeerror-cant-pickle-thread-lock-objects-in-seq2seq). 
#      Solving this issue will probably require to modify the implementation of DQNAgent().
